## Project Overview

During my Summer 2025 Metrology Retention internship at Entegris, I developed a modular suite of VBA macros in Excel to automate the end-to-end processing, analysis, and reporting of metrology data. By transforming raw inputs into structured tables, performing statistical calculations, and generating parameterized, color-coded reports, this solution reduced manual task time from **~38 minutes to under 3 minutes**—a **1200%+ efficiency gain**.

## Features
- **Data Transformation:** Cleans, filters, and reshapes raw datasets into analysis-ready tables.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Computes sums, averages, standard deviations, and flags high-variance results via VBA functions.
- **Dynamic Reporting:** Generates consistent, color-coded workbooks, each with embedded charts and tables.
- **Error Handling & Logging:** Validates inputs and logs anomalies for quick troubleshooting.
- **Modular Design:** Separate macros for each workflow stage, enabling easy reuse and extension.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Microsoft Excel (2016 or later) with VBA enabled.

### Installation & Usage
This repository is a visual and documentation reference for the VBA automation project. The actual VBA code and macro-enabled workbook are not included due to confidentiality. For a demo or anonymized sample, please contact me directly.
